    <h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
    <p><strong>What is this thing?</strong><br />
    This website is a crowdsourced Turing test for donald trump.  Does he pass for a normal human?  Now that he's president, we must answer this question.
    </p>
    <p><strong>y tho</strong><br />
    Because donald might be a prototype robot experiment from the 1970s.  THINK ABOUT IT.  It explains the orange paint job, his decreased random access memory storage, almost-but-not-quite-human speech and mannerisms, <em>everything</em>.  What if he just needs a storage and processor upgrade?</p>
    <p><strong>Are you accepting applications for employership?</strong><br />
    Yes!  Please direct all inquiries to <a href="mailto:likereallysmrt@gmail.com">likereallysmrt@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>The results seem biased towards fake news.  Fake news!</strong><br />
    You're not the one being tested.  If you can only guess the correct answer half of the time, it doesn't mean there's a 50% chance he's a robot.  Rather, it means you cannot tell the difference between him and a robot, so result is naturally closer to 100%.</p>
    <p><strong>What's the deal with The Cloverfield Paradox?</strong><br />
    The Cloverfield Paradox is an exciting sci-fi adventure/horror film largely beset by the fact that none of it makes any goddamned sense at all.  How does the void of space exert a gravitational pull?  How does the space station have access to data storage from a different space station it had no contact with and crashed into an ocean years before?  The point of making space station segments that spin around is to simulate a gravitational pull, but it pushes you up against the wall, like the flying saucer carnival rides.  Moreover, how does anyone actually get <em>inside</em> those spinning segments?<br /><br />
    Once you accept that this sci-fi movie has no science and exists only as a delivery vehicle for creepout moments, it's okay, I guess.</p>
